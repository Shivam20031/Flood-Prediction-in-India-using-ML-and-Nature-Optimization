This project, “Flood Prediction in India using Machine Learning and Nature Optimization”,
targets to broaden a robust predictive model for flood events. Leveraging historical facts
from sources just like the Indian Meteorological Department and Central Water Commission,
the project makes use of gadget studying strategies which includes Artificial Neural
Networks (ANN) and Random Forest models to forecast capability floods. In addition to
predictive technology, the project integrates nature-primarily based solutions like wetland
recuperation to decorate flood resilience. This mixed technique is supposed to enhance flood
prediction accuracy, provide early warnings, and aid sustainable city planning. By regarding
community engagement and local remarks, the project promotes preparedness and resilience,
in the end aiming to shield groups and reduce flood impacts throughout India.
